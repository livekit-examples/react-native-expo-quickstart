# Expo Quickstart App for LiveKit

A basic example to get LiveKit up and running on Expo. 

This app uses [@livekit/react-native-expo-plugin](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native-expo-plugin) to handle the setup required for Expo projects.

See more docs and examples on our website: https://docs.livekit.io/
